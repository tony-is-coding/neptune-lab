/**
 * Run cleanup of caches and tracking state after compaction.
 * Call this after both auto-compact and manual /compact to free memory
 * held by tracking structures that are invalidated by compaction.
 *
 * Note: We intentionally do NOT clear invoked skill content here.
 * Skill content must survive across multiple compactions so that
 * createSkillAttachmentIfNeeded() can include the full skill text
 * in subsequent compaction attachments.
 *
 * querySource: pass the compacting query's source so we can skip
 * resets that would clobber main-thread module-level state. Subagents
 * (agent:*) run in the same process and share module-level state
 * (context-collapse store, getMemoryFiles one-shot hook flag,
 * getUserContext cache); resetting those when a SUBAGENT compacts
 * would corrupt the MAIN thread's state. All compaction callers should
 * pass querySource — undefined is only safe for callers that are
 * genuinely main-thread-only (/compact, /clear).
