/**
 * Leaf state module for the remote-managed-settings sync cache.
 *
 * Split from syncCache.ts to break the settings.ts → syncCache.ts → auth.ts →
 * settings.ts cycle. auth.ts sits inside the large settings SCC; importing it
 * from settings.ts's own dependency chain pulls hundreds of modules into the
 * eagerly-evaluated SCC at startup.
 *
 * This module imports only leaves (path, envUtils, file, json, types,
 * settings/settingsCache — also a leaf, only type-imports validation). settings.ts
 * reads the cache from here. syncCache.ts keeps isRemoteManagedSettingsEligible
 * (the auth-touching part) and re-exports everything from here for callers that
 * don't care about the cycle.
 *
 * Eligibility is a tri-state here: undefined (not yet determined — return
 * null), false (ineligible — return null), true (proceed). managedEnv.ts
 * calls isRemoteManagedSettingsEligible() just before the policySettings
 * read — after userSettings/flagSettings env vars are applied, so the check
 * sees config-provided CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK/ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL. That call
 * computes once and mirrors the result here via setEligibility(). Every
 * subsequent read hits the cached bool instead of re-running the auth chain.
