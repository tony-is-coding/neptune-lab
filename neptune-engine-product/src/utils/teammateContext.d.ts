/**
 * TeammateContext - Runtime context for in-process teammates
 *
 * This module provides AsyncLocalStorage-based context for in-process teammates,
 * enabling concurrent teammate execution without global state conflicts.
 *
 * Relationship with other teammate identity mechanisms:
 * - Env vars (CLAUDE_CODE_AGENT_ID): Process-based teammates spawned via tmux
 * - dynamicTeamContext (teammate.ts): Process-based teammates joining at runtime
 * - TeammateContext (this file): In-process teammates via AsyncLocalStorage
 *
 * The helper functions in teammate.ts check AsyncLocalStorage first, then
 * dynamicTeamContext, then env vars.
