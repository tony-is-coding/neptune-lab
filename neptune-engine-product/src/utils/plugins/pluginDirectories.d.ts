 * Centralized plugin directory configuration.

 * - CLI flag: --cowork
 * - Environment variable: CLAUDE_CODE_USE_COWORK_PLUGINS
 *
 * The base directory can be overridden via CLAUDE_CODE_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR.

 * Get the read-only plugin seed directories, if configured.
 *
 * Customers can pre-bake a populated plugins directory into their container
 * image and point CLAUDE_CODE_PLUGIN_SEED_DIR at it. CC will use it as a
 * read-only fallback layer under the primary plugins directory — marketplaces
 * and plugin caches found in the seed are used in place without re-cloning.
 *
 * Multiple seed directories can be layered using the platform path delimiter
 * (':' on Unix, ';' on Windows), in PATH-like precedence order — the first
 * seed that contains a given marketplace or plugin cache wins.
 *
 * Seed structure mirrors the primary plugins directory:
 *   $CLAUDE_CODE_PLUGIN_SEED_DIR/
 *     known_marketplaces.json
 *     marketplaces/<name>/...
 *     cache/<marketplace>/<plugin>/<version>/...
 *
 * @returns Absolute paths to seed dirs in precedence order (empty if unset)

 * Env-var export sites (MCP/LSP server env, hook env) call this eagerly
 * since subprocesses may expect the dir to exist before writing to it.
 *
 * Sync because it's called from substitutePluginVariables (sync, inside
 * String.replace) — making this async would cascade through 6 call sites
 * and their sync iteration loops. One mkdir in plugin-load path is cheap.
