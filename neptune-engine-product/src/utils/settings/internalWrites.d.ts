/**
 * Tracks timestamps of in-process settings-file writes so the chokidar watcher
 * in changeDetector.ts can ignore its own echoes.
 *
 * Extracted from changeDetector.ts to break the settings.ts → changeDetector.ts →
 * hooks.ts → … → settings.ts cycle. settings.ts needs to mark "I'm about to
 * write" before the write lands; changeDetector needs to read the mark when
 * chokidar fires. The map is the only shared state — everything else in
 * changeDetector (chokidar, hooks, mdm polling) is irrelevant to settings.ts.
 *
 * Callers pass resolved paths. The path→source resolution (getSettingsFilePathForSource)
 * lives in settings.ts, so settings.ts does it before calling here. No imports.
