/**
 * Apply a settings change to app state. Re-reads settings from disk,
 * reloads permissions and hooks, and pushes the new state.
 *
 * Used by both the interactive path (AppState.tsx via useSettingsChange) and
 * the headless/SDK path (print.ts direct subscribe) so that managed-settings
 * / policy changes are fully applied in both modes.
 *
 * The settings cache is reset by the notifier (changeDetector.fanOut) before
 * listeners are iterated, so getInitialSettings() here reads fresh disk
 * state. Previously this function reset the cache itself, which — combined
 * with useSettingsChange's own reset — caused N disk reloads per notification
 * for N subscribers.
 *
 * Side-effects like clearing auth caches and applying env vars are handled by
 * `onChangeAppState` which fires when `settings` changes in state.
