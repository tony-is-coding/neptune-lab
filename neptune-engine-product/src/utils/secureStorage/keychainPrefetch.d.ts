/**
 * Minimal module for firing macOS keychain reads in parallel with main.tsx
 * module evaluation, same pattern as startMdmRawRead() in settings/mdm/rawRead.ts.
 *
 * isRemoteManagedSettingsEligible() reads two separate keychain entries
 * SEQUENTIALLY via sync execSync during applySafeConfigEnvironmentVariables():
 *   1. "Claude Code-credentials" (OAuth tokens)  — ~32ms
 *   2. "Claude Code" (legacy API key)            — ~33ms
 * Sequential cost: ~65ms on every macOS startup.
 *
 * Firing both here lets the subprocesses run in parallel with the ~65ms of
 * main.tsx imports. ensureKeychainPrefetchCompleted() is awaited alongside
 * ensureMdmSettingsLoaded() in main.tsx preAction — nearly free since the
 * subprocesses finish during import evaluation. Sync read() and
 * getApiKeyFromConfigOrMacOSKeychain() then hit their caches.
 *
 * Imports stay minimal: child_process + macOsKeychainHelpers.ts (NOT
 * macOsKeychainStorage.ts — that pulls in execa → human-signals →
 * cross-spawn, ~58ms of synchronous module init). The helpers file's own
 * import chain (envUtils, oauth constants, crypto) is already evaluated by
 * startupProfiler.ts at main.tsx:5, so no new module-init cost lands here.
