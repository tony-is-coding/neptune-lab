/**
 * Unicode Sanitization for Hidden Character Attack Mitigation
 *
 * This module implements security measures against Unicode-based hidden character attacks,
 * specifically targeting ASCII Smuggling and Hidden Prompt Injection vulnerabilities.
 * These attacks use invisible Unicode characters (such as Tag characters, format controls,
 * private use areas, and noncharacters) to hide malicious instructions that are invisible
 * to users but processed by AI models.
 *
 * The vulnerability was demonstrated in HackerOne report #3086545 targeting Claude Desktop's
 * MCP (Model Context Protocol) implementation, where attackers could inject hidden instructions
 * using Unicode Tag characters that would be executed by Claude but remain invisible to users.
 *
 * Reference: https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2024/hiding-and-finding-text-with-unicode-tags/
 *
 * This implementation provides comprehensive protection by:
 * 1. Applying NFKC Unicode normalization to handle composed character sequences
 * 2. Removing dangerous Unicode categories while preserving legitimate text and formatting
 * 3. Supporting recursive sanitization of complex nested data structures
 * 4. Maintaining performance with efficient regex processing
 *
 * The sanitization is always enabled to protect against these attacks.
