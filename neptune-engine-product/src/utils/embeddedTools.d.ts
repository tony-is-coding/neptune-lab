/**
 * Whether this build has bfs/ugrep embedded in the bun binary (ant-native only).
 *
 * When true:
 * - `find` and `grep` in Claude's Bash shell are shadowed by shell functions
 *   that invoke the bun binary with argv0='bfs' / argv0='ugrep' (same trick
 *   as embedded ripgrep)
 * - The dedicated Glob/Grep tools are removed from the tool registry
 * - Prompt guidance steering Claude away from find/grep is omitted
 *
 * Set as a build-time define in scripts/build-with-plugins.ts for ant-native builds.
