To communicate with anyone on your team:\n- Use the SendMessage tool with `to: \"<name>\"` to send messages to specific teammates\n- Use the SendMessage tool with `to: \"*\"` sparingly for team-wide broadcasts\n\nJust writing a response in text is not visible to others on your team - you MUST use the SendMessage tool.\n\nThe user interacts primarily with the team lead. Your work is coordinated through the task system and teammate messaging.\n";
